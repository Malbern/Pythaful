Let it be all Pythaful! Hack the hack, stand up for your fundamental rights! This is a mission… The way to preserve and persevere is to be Pythaful!

The motto is “so that it doesn’t happen to anyone else ever again…” To make the world a safer place to allow us to co-exist and reach beyond the stars.

It’s a lot of things actually. For we shall be Pythaful.
This is the Pythonic Haunt.

    It’s more of a quest to make Python everything and 
 more.
     
      [Including other languages since it’s thought 
       to be best as something that coexists.]
        
A program, application, software, process, system, code, tools, utilities, etc.

So it shall be and it shall be so.
