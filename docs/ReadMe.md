    Expandability, functionality, and the ability to do more with your device. Many things and others such as optimize, clean, secure, modify, enhance, much more and another more to add.

    For Python to be able to exist as a shell, IDE, etc on all devices without the need for any store. Just because it doesn’t have any other language doesn’t mean it doesn’t work with them though.

Let it be all Pythaful! Hack the hack, stand up for your fundamental rights! This is a mission…

The motto is “so that it doesn’t happen to anyone else ever again…” To make the world a safer place to allow us to co-exist and reach beyond the stars.

It’s a lot of things actually. For we shall be Pythaful.
This is the Pythonic Haunt.
    It’s more of a quest to make Python everything and 
 more.    
      [Including other languages since it’s thought 
       to be best as something that coexists.]

Things it shall be.       
The goals for this are…

    A program, application, software, process, system, code, tools, utilities, etc.[^0]
    
        A system to supplement operating systems, to act on its own as a system, and to act as a system of its own.
